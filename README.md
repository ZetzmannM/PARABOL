# Parabol

This is planned to be a long term project with Vulkan written in C++. 
The goal is to create somewhat of a framework that can later be used comfortably to create smaller/simpler games.
It is planned to support Windows & Ubuntu.

It uses:

- GLM library
- GLFW 

It uses the _dep_inc_ folder for any includes necessary for the libraries used.  
It uses the _lib_ folder for any binarys necessary.

Refer to the README.md files in the directiories _dep_inc_ and _lib_ for more information
